Build 20 different models with 80/20 random sampling with replacement.
Then make the decision to classify each indidivudal prediction with the majority percentage.
i.e. if 18 models out of 20 predict "Yes" then you choose "Yes" as final prediction

Stratified shuffling split - good way to include an even distribution in your training data so that
you have an equal balance of loans - for example, if you have a small population of loans that 
default - 2%, you want to make sure you include enough samples so that you have some bad loans.

StandardScaler - idea behind StandardScaler is that it will transform your data such
that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. It is useful when you want
to compare data that correspond to different units. In that case, you want to remove the units. 
To do that in a consistent way of all the data, you transform the data in a way that 
the variance is unitary and that the mean of the series is 0.
